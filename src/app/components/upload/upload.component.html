      <p>The database in use by this application has two collections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>Episodes</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Officers</code>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h5>
        Episodes
        <fa name="angle-double-right"></fa>
        <fa name="angle-double-right"></fa>
        <fa name="angle-double-right"></fa>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The
        <code>Episodes</code> collection is built from two external sources: XCAD and Cafe. The sources must be provided
        in the form of a comma-delimited CSV file. The order and name of each column must conform to a specified format,
        otherwise the file will fail to upload. The application will also expect the user to first load XCAD data for a given
        span of time,
        <strong>then follow this with Cafe data for the same period
        </strong>. Failure to follow this order will result in an inaccurate database.
      </p>
      <p>
        An
        <code>Episodes</code> object consists of a
        <code>Call</code> object and an array of
        <code>Report</code> objects. Data from XCAD is used to build the
        <code>Call</code> object and data from Cafe is used to build the
        <code>Report</code> object array.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many instances, an
        <code>Episodes</code> object will consist only of a
        <code>Call</code> object. This is usually the case when no report is generated from a XCAD event. Conversely, some
        <code>Episodes</code> will only consist of
        <code>Report</code> objects. This is typically observed in TC (traffic citation) report types. Nevertheless, the
        application will take the data provided from the two distinct sources and attempt to build an aggregate database,
        as long as the data is provided in the expected order.
      </p>

      <p>
        The
        <code>Officers</code> collection is maintained by the user and is used to setup productivity reports. It is in this
        collection that a user can control the spelling of the officer's name, the squad they are assigned to, and the effective
        date that their productivity numbers should be applied from. Officers may also be excluded from reports based on
        a setting.
      </p>

          The
          <code>Officers</code> collection is created and maintained by the user. This collection is independent of the
          <code>Episodes</code> collection and is used to assign a number of properties to an officer. Additional features
          include an ability to include/exclude officers from reports as well as designating a start date from which productivity
          should be counted.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <code>Episodes</code> collection is created via CSV files that have been created from a query seperate from this
          application. The XCAD data does not contain information on any possible associations with
          <code>Report</code> data. It will only check to see if an
          <code>&#123;eventNbr&#125;</code> property exists before creating a new record.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Cafe CSV file is next uploaded, which will update/populate the existing
          <code>Episodes</code> collection, creating new documents for the collection when an event number is either not
          provided in the CSV file or not found in the existing collection.
        </li>
